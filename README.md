# Libgcrypt-Library-Cryptographic-program
This is a program runs through AES128 (CTR mode), AES256(CTR mode), RSA 1024, RSA 4096, HMAC MD5, SHA1 and SHA256.
The program measures each operation scheme's performance, you can consider it as some reference codes if you will use Libgcrypt library but my codes are messy because I have little experience in C programming. I hope it will help.
For more details and how to use it, please view my report written for this program (report.pdf in repository).
