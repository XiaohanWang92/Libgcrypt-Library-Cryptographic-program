# Libgcrypt-Library-Cryptographic-program
This is a program runs through AES128 (CTR mode), AES256(CTR mode), RSA 1024, RSA 4096, HMAC MD5, SHA1 and SHA256.
The program measures each cryptographic scheme's performance, you can consider it as some sample codes if you will use Libgcrypt library but my works are kinds of messy because C is not my primary language. I hope it will help.
For more details and how to use it, please view my report written for this program (report.pdf in repository).
