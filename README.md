# Libgcrypt-Library-Cryptographic-program
A program runs through aes128 (CTR mode), aes256(CTR mode), rsa 1024, rsa 4096, HMAC md5, sha1 and sha256.
This program measures each operation scheme's performance, you can also consider it as a starting reference code if you will use Libgcrypt library but my codes are meesy because I have little experience in C programming. I hope it will help.
For more details, please view my report written for this program.
