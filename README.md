# Libgcrypt-Library-Cryptographic-program
A program runs through aes128 (CTR mode), aes256(CTR mode), rsa 1024, rsa 4096, HMAC md5, sha1 and sha256.
This program measures each operation scheme's performance, you can also consider it as some reference codes if you will use Libgcrypt library but my codes are messy because I have little experience in C programming. I hope it will help.
For more details, please view my report written for this program.
